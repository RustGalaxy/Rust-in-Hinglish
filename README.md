**Rust in Hinglish** is a learning resource that aims to teach the Rust programming language using **Hinglish**â€”a blend of Hindi and English. This project is designed for learners, especially those from India, who are more comfortable thinking and conceptualizing in their native language but want to master a systems programming language like Rust.

Here, you will find Rust's core concepts, syntax, and best practices explained in a relatable and accessible manner, making the learning curve less steep and more enjoyable.

> **Note:** This repository is currently under active development. New chapters and content are being added regularly.

## Why This Project?

*   **The Mother Tongue Advantage:** Learning complex technical concepts in a language you are intimately familiar with significantly improves comprehension and retention.
*   **Breaking Down Barriers:** We believe the language of instruction should not be a barrier to entry for learning programming and systems concepts.
*   **Fun and Relatable:** Explanations and analogies in Hinglish are often more relatable, engaging, and memorable for the target audience.

## How to Use This Guide

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/RustGalaxy/Rust-in-Hinglish.git
    cd Rust-in-Hinglish/main
    ```
2.  Navigate to the `main` directory.
3.  Follow the topics in numerical order (e.g., start with `01_kyun_rust.md`).
4.  Type out, run, and experiment with the code examples provided in each lesson on your local machine.
5.  Challenge yourself by solving the practice questions included in the chapters.
